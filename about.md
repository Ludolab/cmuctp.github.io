The Center for Transformational Play at Carnegie Mellon University brings
together world-class expertise from across the university to design, build, and
study transformational games. 

## Who We Are

At the Center for Transformational Play (CTP) we use the power of play to tackle
educational, industrial, and social challenges, from teaching children about
robotics to helping adults with aphasia rehabilitation exercises. Other projects
include playful methods to support climate action, games to help with healthy
sleep, and leveraging game streaming for interactive learning — to give just a few
of our many and diverse interests.

CTP has the interdisciplinary expertise to connect across the university, including
the educational gaming work at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://hcii.cmu.edu) (HCII)
to the transformational game capstones at the [Entertainment Technology Center](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/)
(ETC). We also collaborate with cutting-edge researchers in computer science,
neuroscience, psychology, drama, and art — all areas where Carnegie Mellon’s
excellence can help us advance our work on transformational play.

## What We Do

- create award-winning game design and production
- conduct research related to games
- prototype new technologies for game development
- host interdisciplinary workshops and seminars
- define a visionary agenda for the future of transformational play
